# ClinicAssistant User Guide

ClinicAssistant is a **desktop app for managing patients' records, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
ClinicAssistant requires a lot of typing of various prefixes to add, list or store patients or appointments accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `clinicassistant.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClinicAssistant.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar clinicassistant.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all patients in the ClinicAssistant.

   * `add /n John Doe /p 98765432 /ejohnd@example.com /g M /age 22 /eth Chinese /ic T1234567E a/John street, block 123, #01-01 /t allergy` :
   Adds a patient named `John Doe` to ClinicAssistant the specified details such as male `M`, ethnicity `Chinese` and IC number `T1234567E`.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list of ClinicAssistant.
   * `appt /for 1 /d description details /on 02-01-2024 12:00` : Adds an appointment with specified time to the patient identified with `INDEX` 1 in the list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all patients.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add /n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add /n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `/n NAME [/t TAG]` can be used as `/n John Doe /t friend` or as `/n John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* All commands are case-sensitive. <br>
  e.g. `delete 1` will work, but `Delete 1` or `DELETE 1` will not work.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClinicAssistant home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
