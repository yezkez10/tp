### Enhancements implemented

**New Feature:** Implemented the `list_appt` command and created frontend for appointment list
- What it does: Enables users to see appointment list on the interface and list all appointments in the database through the `list_appt` command.
- Justification: The new frontend improves the user experience by allowing users to see the appointment list on the interface. The `list_appt` command allows users to list all appointments in the database easily.

**New Feature:** Implemented `find_appt` command by date or patient name
- What it does: Add on to the `find_appt` command to allow users to find appointments by date or patient name or both by adding parameters.
- Justification: This feature brings about enhanced user visibility, by providing a targeted way to view appointments associated with a specific person or date. Users can easily focus on the relevant information, streamlining their interaction with the application.

**New Feature:** Make appointment list always sorted by date
- What it does: Sorts the appointment list by date whenever the appointment list is displayed.
- Justification: This feature makes the interface more intuitive and user-friendly by always displaying the appointment list sorted by date which makes more sense to the user.

**New Feature:** Make `edit_appt` and `delete_appt` by index only
- What it does: Makes the `edit_appt` and `delete_appt` easier to use by only taking in the index of the appointment to be edited or deleted.
- Justification: This feature makes the commands more intuitive and user-friendly by making the `edit_appt` and `delete_appt` commands easier to use and less confusing for the user.
